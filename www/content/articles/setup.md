I would like to share how this site was set up.

First, I got a lot of inspiration from this excellent [post](https://smaller.fish/posts/hugo) I found on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30396935)

<!-- more -->

I ended up choosing [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) because it looked interesting and I wanted to try out its [takuki theme](https://www.getzola.org/themes/tanuki/).

Cloudflare also has an excellent [guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-zola-site/) on how to deploy a Zola site.
